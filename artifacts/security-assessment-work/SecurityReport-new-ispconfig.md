## 4. Vulnerabilities and Recommendations

### 4.1 Critical Findings

1. **Inactive Firewall (SC-7)**
   - Finding: UFW is installed but not active
   - Recommendation: Enable UFW with rules allowing only necessary services
   - Priority: High

### 4.2 Significant Findings

1. **Resource Allocation (Performance Risk)**
   - Finding: ClamAV using 34.7% of available memory
   - Recommendation: Adjust ClamAV configuration to optimize memory usage
   - Priority: Medium

2. **Authentication Mechanisms (IA-5)**
   - Finding: Dovecot using only PLAIN authentication
   - Recommendation: Enable additional secure authentication methods
   - Priority: Medium

### 4.3 Advisory Findings

1. **Default Configurations**
   - Finding: Server appears to be using default configurations
   - Recommendation: Review and customize configurations for production use
   - Priority: Low

2. **System Resource Monitoring**
   - Finding: No evidence of resource monitoring tools
   - Recommendation: Implement monitoring for resource utilization and service availability
   - Priority: Low

## 5. CMMC 2.0 Compliance Status

### Level 1 (Foundational)

| Practice | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Access Control | Mostly Compliant | Authentication in place, least privilege not fully assessed |
| Identification and Authentication | Compliant | Proper identification mechanisms in place |
| Media Protection | Not Assessed | Beyond scope of current review |
| Physical Protection | Not Assessed | Beyond scope of current review |

| Security Assessment | In Progress | Current assessment contributes to this practice |

## 6. Conclusion

The ISPConfig server appears to be a recently deployed web hosting environment with a comprehensive set of services. The server implementation follows industry best practices with security measures in place for most critical components. However, several security enhancements are needed to achieve full compliance with NIST 800-53 and CMMC requirements, most notably the activation of the firewall.

The server is configured to host multiple websites, email domains, and databases, making it suitable for small business or commercial web hosting purposes. The current state indicates it is ready for production use after addressing the recommendations in this report.
