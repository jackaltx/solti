# Testing Strategy and Evolution Path

## Current Architecture

### Master Report Structure
The verification system builds a hierarchical report structure designed for both immediate verification needs and future analysis:

```yaml
verify_master_report:
  metadata:
    timestamp: ISO8601
    distribution: string
    molecule_scenario: string
    run_id: epoch
  capabilities:
    metrics:
      start_time: ISO8601
      components: [string]
      checks:
        services: {...}
        connectivity: {...}
        data_flow: {...}
      patterns: {...}
      timing: {...}
    logs:
      # Similar structure for logs capability
```

### Key Features
1. Progressive Data Collection
