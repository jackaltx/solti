# Testing Strategy and Evolution Path

## Current Architecture

### Master Report Structure
The verification system builds a hierarchical report structure designed for both immediate verification needs and future analysis:

```yaml
verify_master_report:
  metadata:
    timestamp: ISO8601
    distribution: string
    molecule_scenario: string
    run_id: epoch
  capabilities:
    metrics:
      start_time: ISO8601
      components: [string]
      checks:
        services: {...}
        connectivity: {...}
        data_flow: {...}
      patterns: {...}
      timing: {...}
    logs:
      # Similar structure for logs capability
```

### Key Features
1. Progressive Data Collection
   - Basic service status

while maintaining backward compatibility and allowing incremental improvement. The hierarchical data 
structure and NoSQL-friendly format enable gradual evolution from basic verification to sophisticated 
pattern analysis and automated test generation.

## Afterword by Jackaltx

(me) I think verify_report (as written) is a dictionary of (lists, dictionaries, scalar).   If I were doing this in some languages what do is give it a var location on the heap to store the data, then on the return I would check it and create a pointer to that.  I would then use the master pointer to loop over the various tests.   

(me) Passing in a master variable feels like one one test will have access to previous tests data.   am I wrong?

(claude) Ah, I understand your thought process! You're thinking about memory/pointer management and data visibility between included tasks. Let me clarify how Ansible handles this:
In Ansible, when using set_fact to modify a dictionary, each task gets its own copy of the variables. Unlike languages where you could pass a pointer/reference to a shared memory location, 
Ansible facts are more like immutable state - each task sees the state as it was when that task started.

(me) Yet as the same time.   consider this....main.yml calls a list of various tests of increasing  complexity (like usage or miss-use).   having access to that an feeding that all-test dictionary will allow feeding it into an learning engine.  and allow the learning engine to postulate new tests to add into the stack.

(claude) Ah, now that's a fascinating perspective! You're thinking about building up a knowledge base of test results that could inform both test analysis and test generation. This completely changes how we should think about the master report structure.

(Sometimes claude seems there with and show understanding the concept. Not always. Notice how he strokes my ego, never really adding to the design, and yet can generate such pretty code.)
