# SOLTI CI/CD Plan

## 1. Introduction
- Purpose: Outline the CI/CD integration plan for the SOLTI project to ensure smooth development, reliable testing, and efficient releases.
- Benefits: Streamline development process, catch issues early, automate deployment, and maintain stable production code.

## 2. Source Control Integration
- Version Control System: Git
- Branching Strategy:
  - `main` branch: Stable, production-ready code. No direct development after v1.0.0 release.
  - `release-X.0.0` branches: Final testing and preparation for major releases.
  - `develop` or `next` branch: Ongoing development work for upcoming releases.
  - Hotfix branches: Critical bug fixes for production code.
- Repository Hosting: GitHub
- Access Control: Maintain strict controls and review processes for merges to `main`.

## 3. CI Pipeline
- Trigger Events: Pull requests, merges to `develop`, `release-*`, and `main` branches.
- Stages:
  - Checkout code
  - Install dependencies
  - Lint code (ansible-lint, yamllint)
  - Unit tests (Molecule)
  - Integration tests
  - Security scans (ansible-vault, SAST)
- Artifact Generation: Docker images, Ansible packages
- Notifications: Slack, email
- CI Platform: GitHub Actions

## 4. CD Pipeline
- Environments: Development, Staging, Production
- Automated Deployment:
  - Targets: Proxmox, bare metal
  - Configuration Management: Ansible
  - Secrets Management: Ansible Vault
  - Rollback Procedures: Ansible playbooks for downgrades
- Manual Approval Gates: Required for Production deployments
- Monitoring Integration: InfluxDB, Loki, Telegraf
- CD Platform: Ansible Tower

## 5. Testing Strategy
- Types: Unit (Molecule), Integration, Performance
- Automation: GitHub Actions, Ansible
- Test Data Management: Dedicated test data repositories
- Environment Provisioning: Ansible, Proxmox
- Reporting: JUnit reports, Slack notifications

## 6. Release Management
- Versioning: Semantic Versioning (SemVer)
- Cadence: Major releases every 6 months, patches as needed
- Release Notes: Auto-generated from Git history and pull request descriptions
- Artifacts: Docker images, Ansible packages
- Approval Process: Peer review, QA sign-off, management approval for major releases

## 7. Infrastructure as Code
- Environment Definitions: Terraform for cloud resources, Ansible for others
- Configuration: Ansible playbooks
- Provisioning: Terraform apply, Ansible playbooks
- Drift Detection: Periodic Terraform plan, Ansible --check

## 8. Monitoring and Observability
- Integration: InfluxDB for metrics, Loki for logs, Telegraf for collection
- Logging: Loki aggregation, Grafana dashboards
- Alerting: Kapacitor, PagerDuty
- Performance Metrics: Telegraf system metrics, application-specific metrics

## 9. Security Considerations
- Credential Management: Ansible Vault, secrets in environment variables
- Compliance Checks: Periodic CIS benchmark scans
- Vulnerability Scanning: OWASP ZAP, Trivy
- Access Controls: Principle of least privilege, regular access reviews

## 10. Onboarding and Training
- Developer Onboarding: Pairing sessions, documentation
- Documentation: README files, wiki pages, Jupyter notebooks
- Incident Response Training: Tabletop exercises, runbooks

## 11. Continuous Improvement
- Metrics: Lead time, deployment frequency, mean time to recovery
- Feedback Loops: Blameless post-mortems, retrospectives
- Process Refinement: Quarterly process reviews and adjustments
- Automation: Continuous discovery and automation of manual processes

## 12. Rollout Timeline
- v1.0.0 Release from `main` branch: June 30, 2023
  - Final testing and bug fixes on `release-1.0.0` branch
  - Merge to `main` and tag as `v1.0.0`
- Ongoing Development:
  - Create `develop` branch from `main` after v1.0.0 release
  - Continue feature development and testing on `develop`
- Expanded Testing on `main`:
  - Implement additional integration and performance tests
  - Conduct thorough regression testing
  - Address any discovered issues with hotfixes
- v2.0.0 Release: December 31, 2023
  - Stabilize `develop` and merge to `main`
  - Release from `release-2.0.0` branch
