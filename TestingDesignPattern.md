# Solti Testing Designe Pattern

## Working on Dynamic Structure

Ah, now I understand - we need to dynamically generate the report based on the `monitoring_capabilities` structure and the collected results in `all_verify_results` and `all_verify_failed`. Let me help create that.

This approach:

1. Dynamically generates capability summaries based on `monitoring_capabilities` structure
2. Includes both capability-level and role-level results
3. Adds container health information from diagnostics
4. Shows verification status for each capability
5. Creates an overall status based on all verification results

The tasks process the collected results using the same structure that was used to gather them, ensuring all capabilities and roles are properly represented.

The key points:

- Uses the standard keys in `all_verify_results` (`capability-shared`, `role-verify-level0`, etc.)
- Handles missing results gracefully
- Maintains the hierarchical structure of capabilities and roles
- Includes both success and failure information

Would you like me to:

1. Show how to format specific sections differently?
2. Add more sophisticated error handling?
3. Include additional metadata in the report?

## Starting Outline

1. **Structure**

- Each verification result is a self-contained unit
- Results are keyed by meaningful identifiers (e.g., `capability-shared`, `role-verify-level0`)
- The structure allows for both hierarchical (capability->role) and flat organization
- The stack can accumulate results from different sources without requiring tight coupling

2. **Data Type Flexibility**
Your point about MIME types is excellent. The current setup could easily be extended to support multiple data types per test:

```yaml
test_result:
  content: |
    === Test Results ===
    ...formatted output...
  mime_type: text/markdown
  metadata:
    timestamp: "2025-02-12T23:46:11Z"
    format_version: "1.0"
    data_uri: "s3://bucket/test-results/metrics-123.bin"
    artifacts:
      - type: application/octet-stream
        uri: "file:///tmp/test-dump.bin"
      - type: application/json
        uri: "http://metrics-store/test/456"
```

3. **Integration Points**
The current structure already supports:

- Text reports (what you're doing now)
- Could add structured data for programmatic analysis
- Could include URIs for external resources
- Could add messaging queue identifiers for notifications

4. **Extensibility**
You could add capabilities like:

```yaml
monitoring_capabilities:
  logs:
    ...
    result_handlers:
      - type: text_report
        format: markdown
      - type: metrics_export
        destination: prometheus
      - type: notification
        target: slack
```

The all_verify_results pattern you've implemented is actually following good separation of concerns:

- Collection (gathering test results)
- Storage (the results stack)
- Presentation (formatting for reports)
- Integration (could add handlers for different output types)

If you wanted to extend this in the future, you've left yourself good hooks for:

- Binary data storage
- External service integration
- Different output formats
- Test result aggregation and analysis
- Automated notification systems

So no, definitely not a faux pas - it's a solid foundation that could be built upon in multiple directions while maintaining backward compatibility with your current usage.
